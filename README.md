# Web-APP-Project-using-Asynchronous-Actions

The objective of the project is to develop a simple web app that interacts with an API asynchronously using HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages.

We will implement a website that searches for Overwatch's Heroes and shows for each resulting item additional information when clicked.
